Uh,Ha!
Hello,every! This is my project ——BotCraft
It can bring AI to Minecraft.
#let's talk about how to use it.
 Find the Keys.json, open it, and enter your API key, address, and model name. Then open the player.json and modify the player's name, skin, and skin model. The "restrictions" in it are the permissions allowed, write in English here, pay attention to the format, and contact the author if you don't. Then open the settings.json, find Version (default 1.19.2, good compatibility, best support for robots), change it to your server main version/supported version, change the IP and Port to your own, if you enter the server and you want to execute instructions, please fill in the instructions behind autorun, add or not/both, "allowed-commands" is the instruction that is allowed to be executed, fill in the instructions that AI can execute. "restricted-commands" are commands that cannot be executed, and if you fill them in, the AI will not be able to execute them.
